                    <dl>
                    While this may not sound a lot, this habit is one impactful way to reduce food insecurity due to its nature of being convenient and easily applicable to our everyday lives. Practices that significantly minimize waste such as storing food properly, and u. By being mindful of your consumption habits, 
                    you not only save money but also help conserve resources and make more food available for those in need.

                    <dl>
                        By supporting our local farmers here in the Philippines, it boosts local companies and economies, 
                        and guarantees that our communities have access to wholesome, fresh food. You'll be supporting the local economy and securing jobs in your community by supporting local farmers, who depend on the support of the local population. Additionally, you are assisting in the preservation of water and land resources. Compared to large-scale farms, local farms frequently use less water and other resources, protecting these resources for coming generations.

                        This strategy is a bit different compared to the other two, since it does not necessarily have anything direct with saving food and water. But it doesn’t mean that it's not that effective compared to the other strategies, in fact, influencing or educating others about the problem with food and water insecurity is one of the most effective. The subject who you wish to educate doesn’t need to be that big of a crowd, even with your neighbors, family, and friends could still count. In this way, the awareness among this issue will spread, and thus more individuals will also observe the practices or habits that promote food and water security.

                        As a community, it is much easier to fight food and water insecurity compared to fighting it alone. One of the things that you can do is to host food banks, of which the food came from the donations in your community. We can typically observe this activity whenever a natural disaster, most commonly a typhoon, drastically affects the condition of a specific community, and which other communities/community chooses to donate food banks.

                        Create and encourage urban farming projects and community gardens. Through allowing locals to grow their own food, these kinds of initiatives develop freedom and provide a convenient supply of fresh produce. To maximize community garden yields, workshops and training programs can be arranged to teach locals sustainable agricultural techniques.
