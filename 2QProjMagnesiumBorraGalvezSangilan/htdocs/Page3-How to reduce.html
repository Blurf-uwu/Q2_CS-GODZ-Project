            Having enough safe food and water is essential since it keeps people healthy, helps communities stay stable,
            and it provides the foundation of a good quality life. Thus, it is essential for one to know a few points that
            improve food security for yourself, and the community.

                        While this may not sound a lot, this habit is one impactful way to reduce food insecurity
                        due to its nature of being convenient and easily applicable to our everyday lives.

                        By being mindful of your consumption habits, you not only save money but also help
                        conserve resources and make more food available for those in need.

                        By supporting our local farmers here in the Philippines, it boosts local companies and
                        economies, and guarantees that our communities have access to wholesome, fresh food.
                        You'll be supporting the local economy and securing jobs in your community by supporting
                        local farmers, who depend on the support of the local population. Additionally, you are
                        assisting in the preservation of water and land resources. Compared to large-scale farms,
                        local farms frequently use less water and other resources, protecting these resources for
                        coming generations.

                        This strategy is a bit different compared to the other two, since it does not necessarily
                        have anything direct with saving food and water. But it doesn’t mean that it's not that effective
                        compared to the other strategies, in fact, influencing or educating others about the problem
                        with food and water insecurity is one of the most effective. The subject who you wish to
                        educate doesn’t need to be that big of a crowd, even with your neighbors, family, and friends
                        could still count. In this way, the awareness among this issue will spread, and thus more
                        individuals will also observe the practices or habits that promote food and water security.

                        As a community, it is much easier to fight food and water insecurity compared to fighting
                        it alone. One of the things that you can do is to host food banks, of which the food came
                        from the donations in your community. We can typically observe this activity whenever a
                        natural disaster, most commonly a typhoon, drastically affects the condition of a specific
                        community, and which other communities/community chooses to donate food banks.

                        Create and encourage urban farming projects and community gardens. Through allowing locals
                        to grow their own food, these kinds of initiatives develop freedom and provide a convenient
                        supply of fresh produce. To maximize community garden yields, workshops and training programs
                        can be arranged to teach locals sustainable agricultural techniques.
