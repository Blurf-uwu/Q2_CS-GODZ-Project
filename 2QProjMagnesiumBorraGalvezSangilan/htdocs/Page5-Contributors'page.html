                    <p>In my humble opinion, food insecurity is an issue that should not persist in the contemporary times. After all, humans have come this far in terms of advancements and stuff. Yet, why would food and water still be a problem to many people? Is it because man is born naturally evil? Probably. Talking about this issue spreads awareness, and hopefully lessons to many. We hope to enlighten people about this issue since it's really not a topic that is often discussed nowadays, yet it remains to be one of the most important problems that our world needs to be solved. Doing this with people like-minded as me made it even better. Well, to say the least, it wasn't that bad. I didn't struggle with cooperating with my groupmates as they took the initiative. I also did my part early so I can play COD more in the future, while they are cramming mwehehehe.</p>

                    <p class="contributor2">Despite the fact that I was in a fortunate situation in which both of my teammates were very smart, I didn't want to contribute less to the group. With them as the heads of the two main parts of our project, I assigned myself to contribute more to the organization and planning. I took initiative in choosing our topic and I chose â€œFood and Water Insecurity" because I believe it is important and deserves more attention. Nowadays, this issue is rarely relevant to the society which is very concerning because it can end us if it becomes worse in the future. Talking about this issue will always be important because food and water insecurity exposes cruelty in our world. Cruelty in the sense that people become greedier and greedier every day, negatively impacting our lives especially those who struggle a lot.</p>

                    <p>When the groupings were announced, my first thought was "I'm gonna carry this team. I'm definitely not gonna procrastinate." Sal is a good leader, so we got someone to remind us and JM desperately wants that uno so he'll definitely do his part. So far, we know what the next step is, the only thing left is actually doing our parts. During G7, we were selected to be part of a SocSci Quiz Bee which we absolutely lost. During our discussions we substituted "let us" with lettuce, hence the name "Lettuce Inc.".</p>
