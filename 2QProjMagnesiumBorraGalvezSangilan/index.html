            <!-- Description of food and water insecurity -->
            Of all the necessities for survival, food and water are among the most fundamental since they give the body the
            nutrition and energy it needs to function properly every day. However, not everyone has the ability to access
            these needs, which is why we now have this very concerning issue known as FOOD AND WATER INSECURITY. Food and
            water insecurity is the inability of human beings to access food and water due to a variety of causes, the
            majority of which stem from social and economic issues in the world such as poverty, unemployment, discrimination, and so on.

                    <p>
                        Food insecurity happens for different reasons. Some people can't access land to grow food, and others lose their land to big investors or government officials. Places with conflicts or violence have trouble producing and getting food. Unfair trade rules make it hard for small farmers to compete. More people in the world mean more pressure on food.
                        Making biofuels takes land away from growing food, leading to less food and higher prices. Natural disasters and climate change also mess up food production. Wasting a lot of food is a problem too, especially in poorer countries. Big companies controlling the food market make it tough for small farmers, causing food crises. Trading food for profit on global markets also leads to big problems.
